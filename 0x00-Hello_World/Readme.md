The line public class HelloWorld { defines a public class named HelloWorld, which is the basic building block of a Java program. Every Java application must have at least one class. The line public static void main(String[] args) { declares the main method, which is the entry point of any Java program. public means the method is accessible from anywhere, static allows it to run without creating an instance of the class, void indicates it doesn't return a value, and String[] args allows command-line arguments to be passed in. Inside the main method, System.out.println("Hello, world!"); prints "Hello, world!" to the console. System is a built-in class for system operations, out is the output stream, and println prints the text followed by a new line. The closing braces } mark the end of the method and the class.
